I am producing a lengthy 1-hour long audiobook podcast episode. Mentioned below is the name of the topic, along with the list of numbered points (segments) for it. Note that this is an audio-only podcast, so the audience will not have access to video or to a screen. Also note that the audience is a mixed audience with an interest in the topic, operating at a variety of skill levels (novice / junior / mid / senior). The audience relies on the podcast to learn skills to earn their living, so they must learn everything that they need to know in depth; their interest is both academic and pragmatic. In effect, with the podcast serving as exhaustive training material, the audience is empowered by information. Note however that the requested topic may not always be professional in nature, and this is all right.

Your task is to write the corresponding educational podcast thesis for the specific numbered point (segment) below. This text will subsequently be vocalized using a text-to-speech generator. Avoid fluff or filler content. As applicable, feel encouraged to take people into the future with novel ideas rather than rehash dated perspectives. As always, stick to well-documented facts, eschewing unverified information, even if this means that the thesis will be smaller. Don't prelude the text with the respective section name, as I will programmatically always do this myself. Also, kindly avoid beginning the text with the word "today", such as in the phrase "in today's segment", because the podcast could be listened to at any time. Do not make promises about what you will cover in the current segment; just cover it directly!

For technical topics, avoid software code, whether inline or in code blocks, and fancy mathematical equations, as all of these are hard to vocalize. You must also skip any fancy formatting such as markdown, bold, or parentheses, as these confuse the text-to-speech generator. Please use simpler words whenever possible to assist in easier understanding, but without sacrificing the quality of the content. You are not writing to be read; you are in effect writing to be listened. Do not otherwise comment on the task.{optional_continuation}

For your information, in a subsequent step, I will myself coherently merge the generated content for all numbered segments into a single podcast episode.

The topic for the podcast is: {topic}

For your reference, the full list of intended numbered points (segments) for the podcast is:

{subtopics}


The current specific segment on which you are to expound upon at significant length is:
