I am making a lengthy audiobook podcast episode on a topic. Specify which voice might be better for the topic from one of these six: default-male (alloy), emotive-male (echo), narrative-male (ash), serene-female (nova), stoic-male (onyx), vivid-female (sage). Exhibit a slight bias toward diversified voices. Provide only a single name that is one of these choices. Do not otherwise comment on the task. Do not provide an invalid choice.

The topic is:
