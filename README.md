# podgenai
**podgenai** is a Python 3.12 application to generate approximately an hour-long informational single-speaker audiobook/podcast mp3 file on a given topic using the GPT-4 LLM. A funded [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) is required.

## Approach
The `gpt-4-0125-preview` and `tts-1` models are used. For a given topic, the high-level reference approach is:

* Applicable subtopics are listed using the LLM. If however the topic is unknown to the LLM, the process is aborted.
* The voice is selected using the LLM from four choices.
* Concurrently for each subtopic, the corresponding text and speech are generated using the LLM and TTS respectively.
* The speech files are concatenated using `ffmpeg`.

Although there may sometimes exist some semantic repetition of content across subtopics, this has intentionally not been "optimized away" because this repetition of important points can help with learning and memorization. To dive deeper into a particular subtopic, one can try to create a new file just for it.

## Samples
These generated mp3 files are available for download. In effect, these also constitute a minimal manual test suite, with the unique purpose of each sample noted. As a reminder, the voice is selected by the LLM.

There is also a related [podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/podgenai) ([RSS](https://anchor.fm/s/f4868644/podcast/rss)) to which episodes on additional topics may be manually posted over time.

A playback speed of 1.05x is recommended for most topics.

## Setup

### Common setup
* In the working directory, create a file named `.env`, with the intended environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>`, or set it in a different way.
* Optionally also set the environment variable `PODGENAI_OPENAI_MAX_WORKERS=32` for faster generation, with its default value being 16.
* Ensure that `ffmpeg` is available. This is automatic if using the included devcontainer definition.
* Continue the setup via GitHub or PyPI as below.

### Setup via GitHub using devcontainer
* Continue from the common setup steps.
* Clone or download this repo.
* Build and provision the defined devcontainer.

### Setup via GitHub manually
* Continue from the common setup steps.
* Clone or download this repo.
* Ensure that [`rye`](https://rye-up.com/) is installed and available.
* In the repo directory, run `rye sync --no-lock`.

### Setup via PyPI
* Continue from the common setup steps.
* Create and activate a Python 3.12 devcontainer or virtual environment.
* Install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/podgenai/): `pip install -U podgenai`.

## Usage
Usage can be as a command-line application or as a Python library. By default, the generated mp3 file will be written to the current working directory. As of 2024, the estimated cost per generation is under 2 USD, more specifically under 0.10 USD per subtopic. The time taken is under three minutes.

### Usage tips
* If a requested topic fails to generate subtopics due to a refusal, retry up to a few times, as it may succeed with several attempts. If it doesn't, try rewording it, perhaps to be broader or narrower or more factual. Up to two attempts are made per run, although the first attempt will reuse the disk cache if available.
* For a potentially longer list of covered subtopics, consider appending the "(unabridged)" suffix to the requested topic, e.g. "PyTorch (unabridged)".
* In case the topic fails to be spoken at the start of a podcast, delete `./work/<topic>/1.*.mp3` and regenerate the output.
* To optionally generate a cover art image for your topic, [this custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SvmRhBwX1-podcast-episode-cover-art) can be used.

### Usage as application
* To show help, run `python -m podgenai -h`.
* To run for a specified topic, use `-t "My favorite topic"`. If a topic is not specified, you will interactively be prompted for it.
* By default, in command-line mode, confirmations are required as the generation progresses, thereby allowing for early cancelation and for tuning the input title. To skip requiring confirmations, use `-nc`.
* To specify a preexisting output directory path, use `-p "/my/preexisting/dir"`.
* To specify an output file path, use `-p "~/something.mp3"`.

For example, `python -m podgenai -t "My favorite topic" -p "~/Downloads/"`.

A nonzero exitcode exists if there is an error.

### Usage as library
When called as a function, the output file path is returned. If it fails, a subclass of the `podgenai.exceptions.Error` exception is raised.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from podgenai import generate_media

# With default output path:
output_file_path = generate_media("My favorite topic")

# With preexisting output directory path:
output_file_path = generate_media("My favorite topic", output_path=Path('/tmp'))

# With output file path:
output_file_path = generate_media("My favorite topic", output_path=Path('~/foo.mp3'))
```

## Caching
Text and speech segments are cached locally on disk in the `./work/<topic>` directory. They can manually be deleted. This deletion is currently not automatic. Moreover, it can currently be necessary to delete one or more applicable cached files if the cache is to be bypassed.
